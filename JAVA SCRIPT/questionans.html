    <h3>1. What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and
                interpreted compiled programming language.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Event Based Programming Language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as
                Server-side developments.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>isNaN() method returns true if a value is Not-a-Number.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Number.isNaN() returns true if a number is Not-a-Number.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>isNaN() converts the value to a number before testing it.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>3. What is negative Infinity?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Negative Infinity holds the negative infinity value of type double.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                This value is obtained by dividing -1.0 by 0.0. Its String
                representation is -Infinity. This value is also a convention, and its
                hexadecimal representation is FFF0000000000000.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape
                Communications Corporation (now Mozilla Foundation) in 1995.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>undeclared also known as not defined.</p>
            <p>
                Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined
                in the current scope, while undefined variables are those that have
                been declared but not given a value.
            </p>
        </li>
        OR
        <li>
            <p>
                undeclared A variable is undeclared if it has not been declared with
                an appropriate keyword (i.e. var, let or const). Accessing an
                undeclared variable will throw a ReferenceError. <br /><br />

                Ex: console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                undefined A variable is undefined if it hasn't been assigned a value.
                undefined is a primitive data type in JavaScript and represents the
                absence of a value, intentional or otherwise. <br /><br />

                Ex: let x; <br />
                console.log(x); // undefined
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                New elements can be dynamically created in JavaScript with the help of
                createElement() method.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The attributes of the created element can be set using the setAttribute() method.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h3>
    <p>
    <table BORDER="2" ALIGN="center" width="60%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8">
        <tr>
            <th width="30%">ViewState</th>
            <th width="30%">SessionState</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Maintained at page level only.</td>
            <td>Maintained at session level.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.</td>
            <td>Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.</td>
            <td>In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed
                or there is session expiration.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Information is stored on the client’s end only.</td>
            <td>Information is stored on the server.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p><br>

    <h3>8. What is === operator?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>=== It's called Strict Equality Operator</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It is used to compare two operands and return true if both the value and type of operands are the same.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Since type conversion is not done, so even if the value stored in operands is the same but their type is
                different the operation will return false. </p>
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Another way to alter the style of an element is by changing its class attribute. class is a reserved
            word in JavaScript, so in order to access the element's class, you use element.className .</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>str = fread(file,flength(file)) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.</p>
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>for - loops through a block of code a number of times.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>for/in - loops through the properties of an object.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</p>
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>In JavaScript parseInt() function is used to convert the passed-in string parameter or
                value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of the base which is specified in the
                second argument of the parseInt() function.</p>
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The delete operator removes a property from an object.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by
                that property is eventually released automatically.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>15. What is the use of Void (0)?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>avaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Navigating to a new page can be done using window. location. assign() . By using assign() , the user will
                be able to get back to the landing page using the “back” button, as this does not change the browser's
                history.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time.</p></li>
        <li><p>When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.</p></li>
        <li><p> Used for Cross-site Scripting</p></li>
        <li><p>Replacement is done everywhere</p></li>
    </ul>
